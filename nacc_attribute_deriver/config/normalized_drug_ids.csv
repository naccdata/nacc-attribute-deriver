bp,unknown,NO_DRUG_ID,"The abbreviation 'bp' is too ambiguous and could refer to multiple things in medical context. While it most commonly stands for 'blood pressure' (a measurement, not a drug), it could potentially be shorthand for various medications like 'bupropion' or other drugs.

The spelling errors include 'chorthor' instead of 'chlorothi' in the middle portion of the name. Hydrochlorothiazide is frequently misspelled due to its complex spelling, and this pattern of errors (particularly confusing the 'chlorothi' portion) is consistent with common misspellings of this medication. The overall structure and length of the word, along with the correct beginning 'hydro-' and ending '-zide', strongly suggest this refers to hydrochlorothiazide."
avista,aricept,d04099,"The raw drug name 'avista' appears to be a typo or mishearing of 'Aricept' (donepezil), a commonly prescribed cholinesterase inhibitor used to treat Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.

tanitidine,ranitidine,d00021,"The raw drug name 'tanitidine' appears to be a typo of 'ranitidine', with the first letter 't' being a substitution for 'r'. Ranitidine is a well-known H2 receptor antagonist commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers. The similarity in spelling with only a single letter difference at the beginning, combined with the distinctive '-nitidine' suffix, strongly suggests this refers to ranitidine."
meprazole,omeprazole,d00325,"The raw drug name 'meprazole' appears to be a common abbreviation or shortened form of 'omeprazole', a widely prescribed proton pump inhibitor used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and other acid-related disorders. The '-prazole' suffix is characteristic of proton pump inhibitors, and omeprazole is by far the most commonly prescribed drug in this class. The 'me-' prefix likely represents a truncation of 'ome-' from omeprazole."
preamitine,primidon,NO_DRUG_ID,"The raw drug name 'preamitine' appears to be a misspelling of 'primidone' (brand name Mysoline), an anticonvulsant medication commonly used to treat epilepsy and essential tremor.

ferrous soy,ferrous sulfate,d03824,"The raw drug name 'ferrous soy' appears to be a typo or mishearing of 'ferrous sulfate', which is a common iron supplement medication. The 'soy' is likely a phonetic misinterpretation of 'sulfate'. Ferrous sulfate is widely prescribed for iron deficiency anemia and is one of the most common iron preparations used clinically."
lautus,lotuss,NO_DRUG_ID,"The raw drug name 'lautus' appears to be a misspelling of 'Lotuss', which is a brand name for a cough suppressant/expectorant combination medication containing dextromethorphan and guaifenesin. The letter transposition from 'lautus' to 'lotuss' is a common type of spelling error, particularly with the 'au' being mistyped instead of 'o' and the missing second 's'. However, I should note that if this doesn't match the intended medication, it could also potentially be referring to other medications with similar phonetic spelling, but Lotuss seems the most likely match given the letter pattern."

falopenin,phenytoin,d00143,"The raw drug name 'falopenin' appears to be a misspelling or phonetic variation of 'phenytoin', a commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug. The phonetic similarity ('falo-' could be a mishearing of 'pheny-' and '-penin' could be a variation of '-toin') combined with the neurological context makes phenytoin the most likely intended drug. Phenytoin is frequently encountered in neurological practice for seizure management and has a distinctive name that could easily be misspelled or misheard as 'falopenin'."
alphagran,alfuzosin,d04797,"The raw drug name 'alphagran' most likely refers to alfuzosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist used primarily for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

thyroid complex,thyroid complex,NO_DRUG_ID,"This appears to be a generic term for thyroid hormone replacement medications or thyroid supplement combinations. Common thyroid medications include levothyroxine (synthroid), liothyronine (cytomel), or desiccated thyroid (armour thyroid). However, 'thyroid complex' is too vague to map to a specific drug brand or generic name, as it could refer to any number of thyroid hormone preparations or nutritional supplements containing thyroid-supporting ingredients.
